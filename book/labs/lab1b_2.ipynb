    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the fundamental concepts of variables, and data types in Python, focusing on their applications within geospatial programming. Understanding these basics is essential for working with geospatial data, as variables allow you to store and manipulate information, while data types define the kind of operations you can perform on this information. This lecture will guide you through variable assignment, naming conventions, and the various data types available in Python, providing practical examples relevant to GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will also explore the fundamental Python data structures: Tuples, Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries. These data structures are essential tools in geospatial programming, enabling you to efficiently store, manage, and manipulate various types of data. By mastering these structures, you will be able to handle complex geospatial datasets with ease, paving the way for more advanced analysis and processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and use variables in Python, adhering to best practices for naming and assignment.\n",
    "- Identify and utilize various Python data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- Understand how data types are used in the context of geospatial data, such as coordinates and attribute information.\n",
    "- Understand the characteristics and use cases of Python tuples, lists, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "- Apply these data structures to store and manipulate geospatial data, such as coordinates, paths, and attribute information.\n",
    "- Differentiate between mutable and immutable data structures and choose the appropriate structure for different geospatial tasks.\n",
    "- Perform common operations on these data structures, including indexing, slicing, adding/removing elements, and updating values.\n",
    "- Utilize dictionaries to manage geospatial feature attributes and understand the importance of key-value pairs in geospatial data management."

    "\n",
    "- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, such as `_`.\n",
    "- The remainder of the variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive, so `num_points` and `Num_Points` are different variables.\n",
    "- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, such as `num_points` instead of `n`.\n",
    "- Avoid using Python keywords and built-in functions as variable names, such as `print`, `sum`, `list`, `dict`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `set`, `tuple`, `range`, `type`, `object`, `None`, `True`, `False`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, `def`, `return`, `lambda`, `class`, `import`, `from`, `as`, `with`, `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `assert`, `del`, `in`, `is`, `global`, `nonlocal`, `yield`, `async`, `await`."
